This directory contains the persistence implementation for the databridge metadata.  There are several 
interesting things to know about this.

1) The data model is drawn from the subset of DDI-Lite that the DataVerse Network (DVN).  There is a 3 level 
hierarchy that includes

   a) collection of files (called a study in DVN) 
   b) the individual files
   c) the variables in the file

One interesting consequence of this decision is that, by default, every file is in a collection even if there
is just 1 file.  I think that's going to be neccessary so that, for example, the abstract class used in the
relevance engine can always take in two objects for comparison that are of a known type.

We are also going to include the concepts of "name space" and "version" in our data model.

2) The implementation follows the Data Access Object, AbstractFactory and Transfer Object patterns. The 
purpose of this is to insulate the users of this code from the implementation (schema and underlying 
data store engine). Done properly, we should be able to switch the implementation from Mongo to Cassandra 
(for example) and none of the application code should care, as long as the Data Model does not change
too much.
