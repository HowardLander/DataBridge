Visualization of data relationship Networks for DataBridge

This network shows the data-to-data relationship in Harris surveys extracted from Odum Institute Dataverse Network at UNC-Chapel Hill. A categorical data similarity measurement algorithm was used to extract a similarity adjancey matrix that was then used to create this data-to-data relationship graph. Each node represents a Harris survey data record; each edge links the pair of nodes based on their similarity measurement --- the darker the edge, the more similar the linked nodes.
